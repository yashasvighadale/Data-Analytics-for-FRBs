# Data-Analytics-for-FRBs

Broadly, my work as a part of this project involved optimizing the data analysis pipeline and classification system at CHIME (Canadian Hydrogen intensity Mapping Experiment), specifically the FRB detection systems CHIME/FRB within CHIME/FRB to be more sensitive to fast radio bursts that are outside of the normal phase space â€” particularly very long timescales or highly scattered FRBs.
